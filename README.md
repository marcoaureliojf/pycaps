**pycaps** is a Python tool for adding CSS styled subtitles to videos. It's designed as both a programmable library and a command-line interface (CLI), making it perfect for automating the creation of dynamic content for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.

## Key Features

*   **Template System**: Get started quickly with predefined templates. Create and share your own templates, packaging styles, animations, and configurations.
*   **CSS Styling**: Style subtitles using standard CSS. Target specific states like `.word-being-narrated` for dynamic effects, cleanly separating style from logic.
*   **Word Tagging**: Tag words or phrases using regular expressions, word lists, or AI. These tags act as powerful selectors for applying custom CSS, effects, or animations.
*   **Advanced Animations & Effects**: Bring words to life with a library of built-in animations (fades, pops, slides) and effects (typewriting, emoji insertion, sound effects).
*   **Whisper-based Transcription**: Automatically generate accurate, word-level timestamps for your videos using OpenAI's Whisper.
*   **Dual Interface**: Use it as a simple CLI for quick renders or as a comprehensive Python library for programmatic video creation.
*   **Offline-First**: The core transcription, styling, and rendering engine runs entirely on your local machine. An internet connection is only needed for optional AI-powered features that require contextual understanding of your script.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, please ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

*   **Python Version**: `pycaps` was tested on **Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12**. Other versions may present issues.

*   **FFmpeg**: You need to have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible from your command line's `PATH`. This is essential for all audio and video processing tasks.
    *   You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow a guide to add it to your system's `PATH`.

## Installation

pycaps is currently in a very alpha stage and is not yet available on PyPI. You can install it directly from the GitHub repository.

1.  **Install FFmpeg**: Ensure you have completed the prerequisite step above.

2.  **Install pycaps from GitHub:**
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/francozanardi/pycaps.git
    ```

3.  **Install Browser Dependencies for Rendering:**
    `pycaps` uses Playwright to render CSS styles. You need to install its browser dependency (this is a one-time setup):
    ```bash
    playwright install chromium
    ```

> ⚠️ **Note**: The first time you use `pycaps`, it will also download a Whisper AI model for transcription. This may take a few minutes and only happens once.

## Quick Start

There are two primary ways to use pycaps: via the command line with a template or programmatically in a Python script.

### 1. Using the Command-Line (CLI)

The fastest way to get started is to use a built-in template.

```bash
pycaps render --input my_video.mp4 --template minimalist
```

This command will:
1.  Load the `minimalist` template.
2.  Transcribe the audio from `my_video.mp4`.
3.  Apply the template's styles and animations.
4.  Save the result in a new file.

### 2. Using the Python Library

For full control, use the `CapsPipelineBuilder` in your Python code.

```python
from pycaps import CapsPipelineBuilder

# The pipeline contains multiples stages to render the final video
pipeline = (
    CapsPipelineBuilder()
    .with_input_video("input.mp4")
    .add_css("css_file.css")
    .build()
)
pipeline.run() # When this is executed, it starts to render the video
```

You can also preload the builder using a Template.
```python
from pycaps import *

# Load a template and configure it
builder = TemplateLoader("default").with_input_video("my_video.mp4").load(False)

# Programmatically add an animation
builder.add_animation(
    animation=FadeIn(),
    when=EventType.ON_NARRATION_STARTS,
    what=ElementType.SEGMENT
)

# Build and run the pipeline
pipeline = builder.build()
pipeline.run()
```
